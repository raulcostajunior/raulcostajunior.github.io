<h2>Two Thumbs Pong</h2>
<p>ttPong is a revisit to the Pong game for touch based handheld devices, in particular for iPhones running iOS 10.3 or later.</p>
<p>ttPong integrates with GameCenter for keeping global leader boards with records achieved by all its players. If you decide to play
ttPong while you're not signed in to GameCenter, only your latest record will be saved locally. If you later sign in to GameCenter, your
locally achieved record won't be saved in the global leader board.</p>
<p>If you have any question about ttPong or would like to suggest a feature or report a bug, please send an email to raulcostajunior at gmail dot com.</p>
